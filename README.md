# image-encrypt-decrypt
This is the MATLAB based project.
Code describes the encryption/decryption logic for an image.
This logic is using the Chaotic behaviour of "IKEDA MAP EQUATION".
IKEDA MAP is a 2 dimensional Non-Linear Dynamical Equation. Chaotic behaviour of the equation means, it always create different values in every iteration. Very small change in the input leads to drastic change in final output

Whole process is carried with some encryption key (any numeric value).
